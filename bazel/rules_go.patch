#
# Bazel RBE on Windows GCP workers currently will not invoke cmd.exe batch files correctly
#
# Symptom is program not found 'bazel-out', because of the way that the CreateProcess command
# is constructed by bazel with actions.run with forward slashes, e.g. the command
#   cmd.exe /c "bazel-out/host/bin/external/go_sdk/builder.exe.bat"
# where cmd.exe on GCP is treating 'bazel-out' as the target, and /host as a command line switch.
# This problem was not observed on Azure CI pipelines or locally by the developers. The eventual
# fix is not specific to rules_go; this patch simply addresses immediate breakage and can be removed
# once the underlying issue within Bazel/RBE is fixed.
# See:
# - https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/pull/2542
